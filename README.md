## Shutdown dialog
Very simple shutdown dialog to make sure user wants to shutdown the computer.
## But why?
This uses the Windows command to actually shut down the computer, not hibernate it.
This should prevent some writes to SSD. Also, makes sure user don't accidentally shut down
the computer using a shortcut to the command (*may have happened to the creator a few times* ðŸ˜‰)
